Hello and welcome to my blog ! My name is Adam and I'm a French PhD student in Hardware Cybersecurity. I have a great passion for exploring the world of hardware security and cybersecurity in general, I love diving into the intricate details of various systems and devices. As an reverse engineer enthusiast, I enjoy unravelling the intricacies of various software and hardware components, which has led me to game hacking, CTFs, Windows internals, and hardware such as FPGAs.

Through this blog, I hope to share my ideas and experiences in the field of hardware security and provide readers with valuable knowledge on the various topics I cover. Whether you are an enthusiast or simply curious about the world of cybersecurity, I invite you to join me on this journey of exploration and discovery. Thank you for visiting my blog and I hope you enjoy the content !

{{< timelineItem icon="graduation" header="DSD 2025" subheader="Salerno, Italy" >}}
I had the opportunity to present my Master's project, <a href="https://github.com/labsticc-arcad/LiteInjector">LiteInjector</a>, at the DSD 2025 conference. With LiteInjector, you can simulate fault injection attacks directly on an FPGA board. incredibly helpful for increasing the speed of your fault injection campaigns.

<b>2023</b><br><br>
I worked on the design of a fault emulation tool designed to test the robustness of SoCs on FPGAs. The tool had to be as modular as possible and incorporate a complex trigger system with several fault models. Several proofs of concept were carried out on different systems: Baremetal, Linux, etc. <br>

{{< timelineItem icon="graduation" header="Hardware Security PhD" subheader="Lab-STICC, University UBS, Lorient, France" >}}
<b>2024 / 2027</b><br><br>
My doctoral research is focused on the identification of hardware and software attacks by utilizing data from the entire System on Chips. on chips. We commence by utilizing Hardware Performance Counters to detect software attacks. We then explore how filtering HPC can reduce the complexity of a detector and improve its detection capabilities.
