Hello and welcome to my blog! My name is Adam and I'm a French Hardware Cybersecurity student. I have a great passion for exploring the world of hardware security and cybersecurity in general, I love diving into the intricate details of various systems and devices. As an reverse engineer enthusiast, I enjoy unravelling the intricacies of various software and hardware components, which has led me to game hacking, CTFs, Windows internals, and hardware such as FPGAs.

Through this blog, I hope to share my ideas and experiences in the field of hardware security and provide readers with valuable knowledge on the various topics I cover. Whether you are an enthusiast or simply curious about the world of cybersecurity, I invite you to join me on this journey of exploration and discovery. Thank you for visiting my blog and I hope you enjoy the content !
