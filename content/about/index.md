Hello and welcome to my blog ! My name is Adam and I'm a French Hardware Cybersecurity student. I have a great passion for exploring the world of hardware security and cybersecurity in general, I love diving into the intricate details of various systems and devices. As an reverse engineer enthusiast, I enjoy unravelling the intricacies of various software and hardware components, which has led me to game hacking, CTFs, Windows internals, and hardware such as FPGAs.

Through this blog, I hope to share my ideas and experiences in the field of hardware security and provide readers with valuable knowledge on the various topics I cover. Whether you are an enthusiast or simply curious about the world of cybersecurity, I invite you to join me on this journey of exploration and discovery. Thank you for visiting my blog and I hope you enjoy the content !

<b>2024</b><br><br>
My work involved evaluating the memory footprint of embedded software for an FPGA with strong constraints. The aim was to optimise the software in Baremetal and on FreeRTOS. <br>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<ul>
  <li>FPGA Develoment</li>
  <li>FPGA Toolchain</li>
  <li>Embedded software</li>
  <li>Low-level programming</li>
  <li>RTOS</li>
</ul>

<b>2023</b><br><br>
I worked on the design of a fault emulation tool designed to test the robustness of SoCs on FPGAs. The tool had to be as modular as possible and incorporate a complex trigger system with several fault models. Several proofs of concept were carried out on different systems: Baremetal, Linux, etc. <br>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<ul>
  <li>FPGA Develoment</li>
  <li>FPGA Toolchain</li>
  <li>Fault injection emulation</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Migen</li>
</ul>

<b>2021</b><br><br>
I worked in the geology department of the university of Tours, my mission was to update a program for calculating nitrogen surpluses in soils to include phosphorus surplus calculations and the addition of new data.

<h3>Skills</h3>
<ul>
  <li>C++</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>SQL</li>

{{< timelineItem icon="graduation" header="Master CSSE" subheader="University UBS, Lorient, France" >}}
<b>2022 / 2024</b><br><br>
The master degree is where I learned the most, the courses are about hardware security as well as software security. I could learn hardware description in VHDL, exploit development and reverse engineering. Moreover, a part of the courses is dedicated to the creation of Linux distributions and their security. This master is really complete and really allowed me to develop my skills. <br>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<ul>
  <li>VHDL (FPGA in general)</li>
  <li>STM32 Development</li>
  <li>C / C++</li>
  <li>Exploit Development</li>
  <li>Reverse Engineering</li>
  <li>Linux Distribution</li>
  <li>RTOS</li>
  <li>Networks for IoT</li>
</ul>

{{< timelineItem icon="graduation" header="Bachelor Computer Science" subheader="University of Tours, Tours, France" >}}
<b>2018 / 2021</b><br><br>
These 3 years of computer science degree allowed me to really master programming languages like Java and C++. I was also able to discover databases (SQL, PostgreSQL) and web programming with PHP, HTML and CSS. Finally, I studied low-level computer science with computer architecture and operating systems.
